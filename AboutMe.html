      <h3>Education (2017-2020):</h3>
      <p>
        I graduated Hillgrove Secondary School in 2020. 
        It was an enriching experience as I was able to help the community by participating in several 
        Values-In-Action (VIA) projects. 
      </p>
      <p>I joined Modern Dance in 2017 and was part of the Exco-Committee from 2019 to 2020. 
        I learnt several skills such as teamwork and communication. 
        In addition, I participated in several school events and SYF 2019.

      <p>I worked as a part-time cosmetic packer at XPO Logistics from 8.30am to 5.30pm from Monday to Friday.
