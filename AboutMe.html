      <p><b>Education (2017-2020):</b><br/>I graduated Hillgrove Secondary School in 2020. 
        It was an enriching experience as I was able to help the community by participating in several 
        Values-In-Action (VIA) projects. </p>
      <p>I joined Modern Dance in 2017 and was part of the Exco-Committee from 2019 to 2020. I learnt several skills such as teamwork and communication. In addition, I participated in several school events and SYF 2019.</p>
