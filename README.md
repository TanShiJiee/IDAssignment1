# ID Assignment 1 
This website is targeted at employers who are planning to hire people for their company. It introduces myself to the employers by giving some information about myself, it includes my portfolio, more about me, how they can contact me and the skills I have acquired.

# Design Rationale
# Features
## Home Page
* Navigation bar: Users can hover over the different pages and the background colour would change.
* Photographs: When users hover over it, the width of the photograph increases slightly, creating a pop-up effect
* Welcome button: When users hover over it the colour of the text changes colour. When it is clicked, it changes to the next page.
For the home page, you will see a navigation bar at the top of the page, when you hover over it the font and background color will change. Net, when you hover over each photo, the width of the photo will increase, creating a pop-up effect. Lastly, for the welcome button, when you click on it will bring you to the next page. So users can either use the navigation bar or the welcome button.

Next for this about me page, when you hover over the different text, the color of the box will change to turquoise color. And when you hover over the picture, the picture will increase in size but it will stay within the container. Giving it interactivity to the users.

Moving on to the skills page, it shows the different skills I have learned over the years for the recruiter to know more about me. When hovered, the opacity of the background increases and the size of the box.

Next, my portfolio page includes my achievements as well as collages of my experiences, travel, and projects I have worked on or are working on. So this is a slideshow where I can press the arrows at the side to go front or back. It includes my certificates and testimonials. Scrolling down, these are the collages. And at the bottom of the page, there is a “scroll up” button for users to go to the top of the page without having to scroll.

Lastly, my contact page, it includes a button that brings users to my LinkedIn account. The page also includes basic contact information like my email and social media account, which also brings you to my Instagram page, by clicking on the icon. Beside it, there is a form for recruiters to fill up if they have any other questions. The form has been validated to ensure users will fill-up the form properly or it will show a reminder message and the form would not be submitted.
